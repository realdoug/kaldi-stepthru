At utterance begin, SIL accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (85,86.4,114) frames.
At utterance end, SIL accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (101,99.4,122) frames.
Overall, SIL accounts for 52.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (30,42.7,112) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 47.9% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (27,29.7,41) frames.
Overall, Y accounts for 28.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (25,24.8,28) frames.
Overall, N accounts for 19.4% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (36,36.8,53) frames.
The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 61.0% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 69.5% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 43.8% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 45.5% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (27,27.7,39)
