At utterance begin, SIL accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (83,85.2,104) frames.
At utterance end, SIL accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (102,110.0,153) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 51.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (30,33.6,56) frames.
Overall, SIL accounts for 48.9% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (29,45.0,111) frames.
Overall, N accounts for 27.8% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (37,39.9,57) frames.
Overall, Y accounts for 23.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (26,26.0,30) frames.
The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 56.2% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 68.1% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 35.7% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.1 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 41.4% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (26,26.4,37)
